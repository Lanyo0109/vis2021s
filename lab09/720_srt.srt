(間奏)

1
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:17,859
Well I've seen the aurora lights

2
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,329
I passed out in Shibuya at night

3
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:23,740
I broke my arm yeah but now it's fine

4
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,720
I keep moving on and on

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,880
And I've had a broken heart

6
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,829
Put it back together, watched it fall apart

7
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,080
I started over from the start

8
00:00:37 ,080 --> 00:00:41,220
I keep moving on and on

9
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,620
So tell me what it means when

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,480
Everything I see is grey and I can't believe

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,120
I'm just going through the motions

12
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,750
Hoping to feel something

13
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,430
Cause baby life is tired when you're on the road

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,480
There's lots of pretty faces that I don't know

15
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,970
I could have a million people at my show

16
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,970
I'd rather come home

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,590
Now time is flying fast and I'm getting old

18
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,250
Don't wanna venture forth into the unknown

19
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,410
I'd be too afraid to be all alone

20
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,049
I'd rather come home

21
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,259

22
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,960

26
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,040
And I broke my arm yea but now it's fine

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,570
